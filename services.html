            <h1>Screenprinting</h1>
            <p>Screen printing is a versatile and popular method of printing onto clothing. It involves pressing ink
                through a stencil, known as a screen, which is stretched over a frame. Each color in the design requires
                a separate screen, usually four or less. This process is typically used for large orders due to the
                setup time involved, but it can produce high-quality prints that are long-lasting and vivid. This method
                can be used on a variety of fabrics, from cotton and polyester to nylon and silk. It is also suitable
                for printing onto a wide range of clothing items, including t-shirts, sweatshirts, and hoodies, as well
                as bags, hats, and other accessories. With the ability to use a variety of inks, including metallic and
                glow-in-the-dark options, screen printing can create striking and unique designs. To ensure the best
                results, a skilled screen printer must carefully adjust the pressure and placement of the ink as it is
                pressed through the screen. This requires expertise and precision, which is why many screen printing
                companies have highly trained professionals who specialize in this craft. With the right combination of
                artistry and technology, screen printing can create stunning, high-quality designs that will last for
                years.</p>

            <h1>Direct to Print</h1>
            <p>DTP (Direct-to-Print) is a printing technique that involves printing an image directly onto a garment,
                without the use of any transfer papers. At Ink'd we offer DTP printing services to our customers who
                want to achieve a soft and natural look on their garments. One of the biggest advantages of DTP printing
                is its flexibility. Unlike traditional screenprinting, DTP allows for printing in multiple colors
                without requiring separate screens for each color. This makes it a cost-effective option for small
                orders or designs with multiple colors. DTP printing is also a great option for customers who want to
                achieve a more intricate and detailed design on their garments. With the precision and accuracy of our
                printers, we are able to produce even the most complex designs with great detail.

            <h1>Direct to Film</h1>
            <p>DTF, or Direct to Film, is a printing method that involves printing directly onto a transparent film
                instead of using a traditional screen. This technique allows for high-quality and precise prints, making
                it a popular choice for designs with fine details or small text. DTF printing also allows for a wider
                range of colors and shades to be used in a design compared to traditional screen printing. Additionally,
                it can be more cost-effective for smaller production runs since there's no need to create and prepare
                screens. Overall, DTF printing is a versatile and efficient technique that can produce high-quality
                prints for various types of designs.</p>
